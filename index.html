       <p>Hello. In my life, I have had the opportunity to start programming more than once. It was Pascal in high school, Visual Basic at university and now, at work, I have to implement simple macros in VBA Exel sometimes.. But it was not serious, without the normal work program and the leaders.
        Now I have a chance to learn programming correctly and professionally at The Rolling Scopes school. This is my first CV project therefore you shouldn’t concern prejudicedly, although you can scold me for mistakes - I’d thank you for it.
        </p>
